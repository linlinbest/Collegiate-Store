# Collegiate-Store -- 2018 Fall Rensselaer Center for Open Source (RCOS) Project
-----------
Collegiate Store + is an open source website where students have an access to RPI Collegiate Store in 360° display. It saves customers’ time and ensure online shopping quality. It also aims to solve the problem of limited open hours of offline collegiate store, and to promote school brands and selling. 

## Background 
It is believed that 50% of all retail this year is going to be influenced by mobile devices. Virtual shopping really is the new trend. Yet, VR technology is very young and numerous computer scientists are working on it. RPI Collegiate Store sells textbooks, stationery, school clothes, iclickers, and almost anything. But it usually takes students a hard time to find things offline. Collegiate store has a website but the shopping quality cannot be guaranteed. 

## Project Goals
To give students an access to a full dimension view of collegiate store
To create a high-tech school collegiate store for a high-tech school like RPI
To explore languages that build VR and gain more experiences in working on an open-source project as a group
